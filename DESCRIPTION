Description: This package implements a fine-mapping method based on the 
    "heritability-induced Dirichlet Decomposition" (h2-D2) prior,
    as described in 
    https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.23293456v1.
    It is a novel fine-mapping method that utilizes a continuous global-local 
    shrinkage prior.
    This method can be applied to both quantitative and binary traits.
    An MCMC algorithm is employed to obtain samples from the posterior 
    distribution.
    This method can also provide "credible sets" of candidate
    causal variants, which are generally provided by fine-mapping methods
    based on discrete-mixture priors.
